# React-Warehouse-App
Coding Bootcamp Final Project

## Concept
Our group wanted to make a warehouse inventory management app because of our group members' experience working in warehouses, 
and their stories of unorganized managers, confused forklift drivers, and trying to find product that "should" be in the right 
place. The goal of this app is to eliminate as much human error as possible when dealing with inventory, and to allow all
warehouse employees access to the inventory data, while only allowing the managers to add or delete items, rows, sections, 
etc.
